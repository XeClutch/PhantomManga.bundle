# PhantomManga.bundle
Plex channel that acts as a compatibility layer for the PhantomManga windows application. Using this will allow you to stream all of the manga you've downloaded using PhantomManga directly to Plex.
This has been tested to work on a Windows based Plex server but will stream to Plex without issue regardless of which platform you're using.
